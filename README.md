# Temp_Humidity_Logger
This is a repo to run a DHT22 on a Raspberry Pi (running Raspian) with an I2C OLED Display.  It is built to auto size text to font choice and size and can be configured for different size OLED displays.  It is storing to an Influx DB as a time series.  The OLED interface code was taken from animate.py in the adafruit examples and then everything was modified and added from that basis (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).  The basic DHT code was taken from a raspberry pi tutorial (https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-measure-humidity-temperature-dht11-dht22/) which was helpful in recovering from sensor errors.  This is not fancy but is a good basis if you are logging the data and want a good starting point with multiple display and sensor tools and one that is robust for startup errors tied to the cheap sensor.  I have been running it 24/7 for weeks and it doesn't crash and doesn't really stress the raspberry pi 3 in anyway.
